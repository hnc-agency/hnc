=== Prolonged worker startup phases

When a pool needs to start new workers to satisfy checkout
requests, it does so in parallel. +
This means that, when several checkout requests arrive at about
the same time, for which new workers need to be started, the
a worker does not have to wait for the ones before to complete
their start phase before it can be started.

Still, you may want to keep the startup phases of your workers
as short as possible, since a user will still have to wait for
that amount of time before it receives a newly started worker.

To achieve short startup phases, you may consider returning
the worker pid from the respective `start_link/1` function
immediately, and do any initialization in a separate step,
maybe even when the worker is being used for the first time.
