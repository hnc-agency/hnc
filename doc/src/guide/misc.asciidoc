=== Worker startup and shutdown phases

You should keep the startup and shutdown phases of workers as short
as possible, otherwise the performance of the pool in terms
of checkout time will suffer when it needs to start a new worker to
satisfy a checkout request.

To achieve short startup phases, you may consider returning
the worker pid from the respective `start_link/1` function
immediately, and do any initialization in a separate step,
maybe even when the worker is being used for the first time.

To achieve short shutdown phases, your worker may fire off a
separate process to do the cleanup, and exit itself.
