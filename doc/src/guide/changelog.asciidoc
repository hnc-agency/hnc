== Changelog

=== 0.1.0

First release.

=== 0.2.0

Mostly refactoring, cleanup, and some new features.

* `give_away/3,4`: Designate another process as owner of a worker.

* Only the process owning a worker is allowed to check it in.

* Checking in and giving away from inside transactions is not possible
  any more.

* The API functions now work with worker identifiers instead of
  worker pids. To get the "real" worker, `hnc:get_worker/1` must
  be used to obtain the worker pid from the identifier.

* Added documentation for embedded mode and advanced usage.

=== 0.3.0

Mostly refactoring and cleanup, and some new features.

* Workers are started and stopped in parallel, ie do not slow down
  each other.

* `prune/1`: Shrink the pool by evicting idle workers.

* Starting, returning and stopping workers has been implemented
  into the `hnc_pool` module/process itself, removing the need
  for the `hnc_workercntl` and `hnc_workercntl_sup` modules/processes.

* The pool rooster is now an `ets` table, not a `map`.

* The pool does not wait for the initial workers to complete their
  startup before becoming operationali any more.
